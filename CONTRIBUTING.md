# Contributing to ODEI

ODEI is an open-source world model infrastructure for AI agents. We welcome contributions!

## What We're Building

A constitutional knowledge graph that gives AI agents:
1. **Persistent memory** — Neo4j graph that survives session boundaries
2. **Safety validation** — 7-layer constitutional guardrails
3. **On-chain identity** — ERC-8004 on Base and BSC

## How to Contribute
