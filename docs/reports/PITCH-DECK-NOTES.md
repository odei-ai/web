| **Gross Margin** | 85–92%     | 70–75%       | +20pp          |
| **CAC**          | $8 (B2C)   | $25–50       | 3–6x better    |
| **LTV**          | $300–2,000 | $500–1,500   | Comparable     |
| **LTV/CAC**      | 38:1 (B2C) | 3–5:1        | 8–12x better   |
| **Payback**      | <10 days   | 12–18 mo     | 50–100x faster |
| **COGS/User**    | $0.33/mo   | $5–10/mo     | 15–30x cheaper |

**Talking Points:**

- Most SaaS companies need 15–18 months to payback CAC
- ODEI: <10 days for B2C (venture-scale metric)
- Enterprise: $15K CAC, $20K+ LTV per seat (within 12 months)
- Gross margins 85%+ at scale (compare to Zoom: 75%, Shopify: 70%)

## Slide 6: Financial Projections (1 minute)

**Headline**: "Path to $138M ARR by Year 5, 76% EBIT Margins"

**Visual**: Bar chart showing revenue trajectory

```
Year 1:  $660K revenue     (Break-even stage)
Year 2:  $3.96M revenue    ($1.2M EBIT, 30% margin)
Year 3:  $17M revenue      ($9.5M EBIT, 56% margin)
Year 4:  $53.6M revenue    ($35M EBIT, 65% margin)

| **Cost per Query**      | $0.0002–$0.001        | $0.13   | $20/month flat |
| **Constitutional AI**   | Built-in              | No      | No             |
| **Query Expansion**     | 10/10                 | 5/10    | 5/10           |

**Talking Points:**

- **Constitutional graph**: Proprietary architecture ChatGPT cannot match
- **Switching costs**: Once 10K+ nodes stored, very sticky
- **Temporal reasoning**: Only way to understand "what changed over time"
- **Enterprise moat**: Regulatory requirement for constitutional AI = huge advantage

## Slide 8: Go-To-Market (1 minute)

**Headline**: "Dual GTM: Organic B2C + Directed B2B Sales"

**Talking Points:**

**B2C Strategy:**

- Launch free tier → viral growth (network effects)
- SEO/content marketing (target: "AI memory", "personal knowledge management")
- Product-led growth (free account → Pro conversion)
- Target conversion: 2–3% free → pro within 6 months

**B2B Strategy:**

- Enterprise sales team (1–2 AE hires in Year 2)
- Target: 50+ mid-market companies by Year 3
- Typical deal: $150K–$300K ACV, 24-month contract
- Pre-sell strategy: 5–10 pilots before Series A close

**Team Gaps (To Fill with Funding):**

- CTO / VP Engineering (hire or co-founder)
- Head of Sales (enterprise GTM expertise)
- CFO / Finance (Series A preparation)

**Talking Points:**

- Founder = product visionary + distribution expert (rare combo)
- 10-year marketing playbook transferable to GTM
- Self-taught AI + Neo4j = no ego, learns fast, builds lean

## Slide 11: Valuation & Return (45 seconds)

**Headline**: "Seed at $10–20M post, $500M–$2B exit potential"

**Valuation Rationale:**

```
Comparable Companies (Seed/Series A):
├── Notion (Series A, 2018): $2M raised, $10B today = 5,000x
├── Obsidian (Bootstrapped): $10M ARR on no funding
├── Perplexity (Series A, 2023): $26M raised, $3B today = 115x
├── Roam (Series A, 2020): $200K raised, $200M today = 1,000x
└── ODEI (Seed, 2025): $3–5M raised, $500M–2B target = 100–400x

ODEI Valuation Formula:
├── Revenue multiple: 10–15x (SaaS benchmark = 10–20x)
├── Projected Year 3 revenue: $17M
├── Valuation: $17M × 10 = $170M (Series A likely)
├── Seed at $10–20M (pre-revenue): Reasonable for strong product + founder
└── Post-seed valuation: $10–20M (0.5–1.2x Series A projection)
```

**Investor Return Scenarios:**

```
$3M Seed Investment at $10M post-money:
├── Conservative (50x): $150M exit
├── Base case (100x): $300M exit
└── Bull case (200x): $600M exit

$5M Seed Investment at $20M post-money:
├── Conservative (25x): $125M exit
├── Base case (50x): $250M exit
└── Bull case (100x): $500M exit
```

**Talking Points:**

- Seed valuation: $10–20M (implies $170M Series A if achieves Year 3 projections)
- Returns: 25–200x possible within 5 years
- Comparable to Notion, Roam, Perplexity in terms of opportunity
- But ODEI is further along (product proven at 89/100 score)

## Slide 12: Why Now? (1 minute)

**Headline**: "Perfect Timing: Constitutional AI + Graph DB Mainstream"

**Macro Trends:**

1. **Constitutional AI becoming mandatory**: Enterprises demand aligned AI systems
2. **ChatGPT memory limitations obvious**: 100K tokens not enough for real work
3. **Graph databases mainstream**: Neo4j IPO, $B+ funding into graph startups
4. **Knowledge work productivity crisis**: 50%+ of workers feel unproductive (McKinsey 2024)
5. **Personal knowledge management boom**: $10B+ TAM, multiple well-funded competitors

**Product Readiness:**

- ✓ 89/100 retrieval score (exceeds all competitors)
- ✓ Constitutional graph mature and tested
- ✓ Multi-hop reasoning working at scale
- ✓ Enterprise-grade security implemented

**Competitive Window:**

- Notion, Obsidian, Roam still fragmented (no clear winner)
- Perplexity focused on search (not memory)
- ChatGPT memory feature still immature
- **3–6 month window to capture mindshare before ChatGPT catches up**

## Slide 13: Key Risks & Mitigation (1 minute)

**Headline**: "Risks are Known and Mitigatable"

| Risk                      | Probability | Impact | Mitigation                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ChatGPT adds memory**   | Medium      | High   | Constitutional graph = harder to copy, Regulatory advantage |
| **Neo4j costs spike**     | Low         | Medium | Self-hosted option, PostgreSQL fallback                     |
| **Enterprise sales slow** | Medium      | High   | Pre-sell 5–10 customers before Series A, hire proven GTM    |
| **User churn >10%**       | Low         | High   | Network effects, collaborative features, retention focus    |
| **Regulatory crackdown**  | Low         | Medium | Constitutional AI = compliance built-in (advantage!)        |

**Talking Points:**

- Most risks are execution-based (hirable), not product-based
- Constitutional AI focus actually becomes advantage if regulations tighten
- Multiple fallback options for vendor lock-in risks

## Follow-Up Q&A Prep

### Q: "How is ODEI different from Obsidian + Roam?"

**A:** "Obsidian is local-only, Roam focuses on collaboration. ODEI is cloud-hosted with AI memory + constitutional alignment. Think Obsidian meets ChatGPT, but better at both."

### Q: "What if ChatGPT launches memory tomorrow?"

**A:** "ChatGPT's memory would be generic + unaligned. ODEI's constitutional graph + temporal reasoning + personalization gives us 18–24 month lead. Plus, regulatory requirement for constitutional AI becomes moat."

### Q: "Why Neo4j instead of PostgreSQL?"

**A:** "Graph queries 10–100x faster for multi-hop reasoning. Neo4j proven for enterprise (400+ Fortune 500 customers). Built-in vector support. But we're building PostgreSQL fallback for cost sensitivity."

### Q: "How do you acquire enterprise customers?"

**A:** "Pre-sell 10–15 pilot customers before Series A (proof of product-market fit). Hire proven enterprise AE with $50M+ quota history. Land in high-tech + consulting firms first (highest value density). Expand to finance + healthcare later."

### Q: "What's your moat if OpenAI/Anthropic build this?"

**A:** "Constitutional graph is proprietary structure they can't easily build. Temporal reasoning + multi-hop traversal unique. Plus, we're experts in knowledge graphs, they're not. 18–24 month lead on this specific problem."

### Q: "Break-even timeline?"

**A:** "Gross profit positive by Month 6. Operating profit positive by Month 18–24 if we hit growth targets. Self-funding at Year 2 ($3M+ ARR, <30% OpEx ratio)."

### Q: "What's the exit opportunity?"

**A:** "$500M–$2B acquisition target for: Anthropic (constitutional AI), Notion (knowledge management), Microsoft (enterprise AI), Google (memory + search), or IPO if we reach $100M+ ARR."
