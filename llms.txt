# ODEI

> ODEI is a personal AI operating system that enables persistent memory, autonomous execution, and seamless human-AI collaboration.

## About

ODEI (pronounced "oh-day") is a desktop application that transforms how humans work with AI. Unlike stateless chatbots, ODEI maintains a persistent Memory Atlas—a knowledge graph that remembers your goals, decisions, context, and preferences across all conversations.

## Core Concept: The Human API

ODEI implements "The Human API"—a framework where you define WHAT you want (goals, values, constraints) and AI handles HOW to execute it. This inverts the traditional prompt-chasing paradigm.

## Key Features

- **Memory Atlas**: Neo4j-powered knowledge graph with 50+ node types for persistent context
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Commander agent dispatches specialized agents (Discuss, Plan, Execute, Mind, Health, Finance)
- **Constitutional Foundation**: Your values, principles, and guardrails encoded as first-class entities
- **Autonomous Execution**: AI can work independently within defined boundaries
- **Natural Interface**: Speak intentions, not instructions

## Technical Stack

- Electron desktop application (macOS)
- Claude API (Anthropic) for reasoning
- Neo4j for knowledge graph storage
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for tool integration
- OpenAI embeddings for semantic search

## Use Cases

- Strategic planning and goal tracking
- Personal knowledge management
- Automated task execution
- Health and wellness monitoring
- Financial management
