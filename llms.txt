# ODEI — World Model as a Service
# https://api.odei.ai

> Persistent memory infrastructure for AI agents. 6-layer knowledge graphs on Neo4j with token-gated API access. $ODAI on Base.

ODEI provides World Model as a Service (WMaaS) — structured, persistent knowledge graphs that give AI agents long-term memory. Each world model has 6 layers: Foundation, Vision, Strategy, Tactics, Execution, Track. Nodes represent goals, tasks, people, metrics, decisions, and more. Relationships encode how everything connects.
