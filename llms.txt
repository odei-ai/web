# ODEI: The Human Kernel

> "The gap isn't in what AI can do. It's in what AI is allowed to do."

## Summary
ODEI (Open Digital Evolution Intelligence) is a local-first Operating System that integrates Biological Telemetry (via Apple HealthKit), Financial Data, and Contextual Graphs (Neo4j) to give AI agents true agency under human supervision.

## Core Concepts
- **Human Kernel:** A control layer between the Biological User and the Cloud AI.
- **Symbiosis:** AI uses bio-feedback (e.g. HRV readiness) to adjust task load and risk protocols.
- **Sovereignty:** All context is stored in a local Memory Graph (Neo4j). Use `npm run start` to launch the Gateway.
